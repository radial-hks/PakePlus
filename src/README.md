# WebSocket Client Webpage

This directory contains a modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based WebSocket client.
It allows you to connect to a WebSocket server, send JSON messages, and view received messages with an enhanced user interface and improved JSON handling capabilities.

## Features

-   Connect to a specified WebSocket server URL.
-   Disconnect from the server.
-   Display connection status (Idle, Connecting, Connected, Disconnected, Error) with color-coded visual indicators.
-   Text area to compose JSON messages with real-time validation.
-   Real-time JSON validation with error feedback.
-   One-click JSON formatting button to properly indent and format JSON.
-   Smart button state management (send button only enabled when connected and JSON is valid).
-   Text area to display messages received from the server (automatically pretty-prints JSON).
-   Button to clear the received messages log.

## How to Use

1.  **Ensure a WebSocket server is running.**
    *   The client defaults to connecting to `ws://localhost:5151`. You can change this URL in the input field on the page.
    *   The backend service this page is intended to communicate with (as suggested by the project's `src/index.ts`) is expected to be at this address.

2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**
    *   Navigate to the `public` directory of this project.
    *   Open the `index.html` file directly in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). No special build step is required for this simple client.

3.  **Connect to the WebSocket Server:**
    *   Verify or enter the WebSocket server URL in the input field.
    *   Click the "Connect" button.
    *   The status should update to "Connected" with a green indicator if successful.

4.  **Compose and Validate JSON Messages:**
    *   Once connected, type your JSON message into the "Send Message (JSON)" text area.
    *   The system will automatically validate your JSON in real-time as you type.
    *   A validation status indicator will appear in the top-right corner of the text area:
        * Green indicator with "格式正确" means the JSON is valid.
        * Red indicator with an error message means the JSON is invalid.
    *   If your JSON is not properly formatted, click the "格式化" button to automatically format it with proper indentation.

5.  **Send and Receive Messages:**
    *   The "Send" button will only be enabled when both connected to the server and the JSON is valid.
    *   Click the "Send" button to transmit your message.
    *   Messages sent and received will appear in the "Received Messages" text area.

5.  **Disconnect:**
    *   Click the "Disconnect" button to close the WebSocket connection.
